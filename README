=======

The goal for this library is to provide a convenient, standards compliant API for the d language.

Steps to follow to get a complete API (in order of importance):

- Define the basic classes from XmlNode to XmlDocument etc. as required to represent an in memory representation of an xml structure.
- Define an abstract XmlWriter and implement an XmlStringWriter
- Define an abstract XmlReader and implement an XmlStringReader
- Add nice-to-have features like xpath

Minimum required classes for the DOM structure, in no particular order:

XmlNode, XmlNodeList, XmlAttribute, XmlElement, XmlDocument, XmlText, XmlComment, XmlCDataSection, XmlProcessingInstruction
